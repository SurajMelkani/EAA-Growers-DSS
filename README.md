This Everglades Growers Decision Support System (DSS) is a specialized research tool developed as part of your PhD candidacy at the University of Florida within the Department of Soil, Water, and Ecosystem Sciences.

It is important to note that this application is currently a functional prototype and research demonstration; it is not intended for general public or commercial agricultural use at this stage.

🛠️ Technical Core & Methodology
The platform integrates several advanced components of your research into a single interactive interface:

Spatial Predictive Modeling: The system utilizes a coordinate-based model to estimate Soil Organic Matter (SOM) and Soil Depth across the diverse landscape of the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA).

Carbon Dynamics Logic: The backend contains the core mathematical models you developed to calculate carbon sequestration potential and CO₂ emission offsets based on specific crop selections and soil profiles.

Management Protocol Engine: The guidance provided is driven by a diagnostic logic that interprets soil health indicators—such as pH and SOM levels—to suggest targeted Best Management Practices (BMPs).

Precision Geography: By leveraging GeoPandas and Folium, the app allows for high-fidelity spatial selection, enabling growers to draw specific field boundaries for localized analysis.

🧪 Research Context
This DSS serves as a digital twin of your broader academic work focused on:

Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics: Understanding the drivers of carbon stability in South Florida's unique muck soils.

Machine Learning Integration: Using data-driven approaches to predict subsidence risk and soil health indicators.

Remote Sensing: Future iterations are designed to integrate data collected via your FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot operations, bringing high-resolution drone imagery into the predictive loop.
